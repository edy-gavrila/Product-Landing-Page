# Product-Landing-Page
## In this small project I used html and css to create a small product landing page.
### I made the page responsive using media queries.


It is quite a straightforward project but the CSS file has gotten considerably big which makes the use of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap a good alternative.

The styling is inspired from one of the FreeCodeCamp Projects.
